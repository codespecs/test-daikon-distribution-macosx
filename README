This is a dummy project to make Travis run tests to test the Daikon
distribution.  It's a separate job from the Linux one because Travis does
not currently support switching the JDK version on MacOSX.

To start a job:

  $pl/bin/trigger-travis.sh codespecs test-daikon-distribution-macosx `cat ~/private/.travis-access-token`

where $pl is a clone of plume-lib (https://github.com/mernst/plume-lib.git).
